Another good decision by the Modi government on the suggestion of Superstar Akshay Kumar :* ........
* Daily payment of only one rupee, that too for the Indian Army. In the cabinet meeting yesterday, the Modi government opened a bank account for the modernity of the Indian Army and for the soldiers who are injured or martyred in the war zone. In which every Indian can donate any amount on his own free will. Which starts from Rs.1 and is unlimited.*
* This money will also be used to buy weapons for the army and paramilitary forces. Taking a final decision on today's burning situation on Mann Ki Baat and suggestions of people on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Modi government has opened Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualty Fund account in New Delhi, *Canara Bank.*
* This is the master stroke of Film Star Akshay Kumar. From where no one can stop India from becoming a super power. If even 70% of India's 130 crore population puts only one rupee daily in this fund, then that one rupee will be 100 crores in a day. 3000 crores in 30 days and 36000 crores in a year. 36,000 crores is not even the annual defense budget of Pakistan. We spend 100 or 1000 rupees daily in useless work, but if we give one rupee for the army, India will definitely become a super power.
* Your money will be directly deposited in the Defense Ministry's Army Assistance and War Casualty Fund. Which will be useful for military material and army personnel.
*That's why help the army directly by joining this campaign of Modiji.*
Nothing will happen by doing hi hi kar Pakistan, blocking roads and making rhetoric. Implement the thinking of Modi and the people of the country and strengthen the army of our country. So that countries like Pakistan and China can be told their status without the help of any other country. Bank details are given below.
*Bank Details:*
*CANARA BANK*
*A/C NAME: ARMY WELFARE FUND BATTLE CASUALTIES,*
*A/C NO:* *90552010165915*
*IFSC CODE:* *CNRB0000267*
