211	0.2682	0.0658	The Irish slave trade began in the 17th century when 30,000 Irish prisoners were sold as slaves to the New World, following King James I's 1625 proclamation. By mid-1600s, Ireland became the primary source of slaves for English merchants, with Irish slaves constituting 70% of Montserrat's population. From 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves, reducing Ireland's population from about 1.5 million to 600,000 in a decade. The British separated Irish families, leading to a population of homeless women and children who were subsequently auctioned off. 

During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children aged between 10 and 14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia, and New England. The English masters treated African slaves, who were more expensive, better than their Irish counterparts. Irish slaves were cheap and their deaths were not considered a crime. The English masters began breeding Irish women for their own pleasure and profit. 

The English settlers started to breed Irish women and girls with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion, a practice that was widespread until legislation was passed in 1681 forbidding it. England continued to ship tens of thousands of Irish slaves for more than a century. After the 1798 Irish Rebellion, thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. The Irish experienced the horrors of slavery as much as the Africans did in the 17th Century. The brown, tanned faces seen in the West Indies are likely a combination of African and Irish ancestry. 

In 1839, Britain ended its participation in the slave trade, concluding this chapter of Irish misery. The history of Irish slavery is a subject worth remembering.	Irish workers were slaves in Americas

348	0.2693	0.2147	In 2015, volcanologists discovered that Mt. Timolan in Zamboanga Del Sur, previously thought to be a mountain, is an inactive volcano. Rising 4,580 meters above sea level and with a diameter of 9,853 square meters, it is surrounded by two wide plains and Lake Maragang. The hot springs on its top and along the ridge are actually a volcanic crater and lava fusions respectively, which over the last 400 years have become hot springs. The volcano, named "Timolan" or "The Sleeping Giant" by locals, is the largest and tallest in Western Mindanao. There is concern that it could become active again, as has happened with other volcanoes like Pinatubo, Mayon, and Taal when fault lines in their areas caused earthquakes. Four such earthquakes have recently been reported in Zamboanga Del Sur. The volcano's size and potential range of destruction, which could extend over 40km and cover the entire peninsula in ash, are particularly alarming. Towns in Tigbao, including Timolan, Tigbao, Nilo, Maragang, Tuburan, Lacupayan, Limas, Guinlin, Lacarayan, Begong, Woodland, Caluma, Diana Countryside, Nanganangan, and Mate, are most at risk due to their proximity to the volcano. According to local history, the volcano erupted before the pre-Spanish colonial times, creating the two plains and Lake Maragang and killing many natives with its ash clouds. If it were to erupt again, the damage could potentially exceed that of Mt. Pinatubo's eruption.	Mt. Timolan in Zamboanga Del Sur province is a volcano which scientists worry could erupt

This reaction, which he refers to as mast cell degranulation, occurs after the viral phase ends and manifests as chest tightness and fatigue. Chetty observed that patients typically worsen on the 8th day of illness, rapidly developing symptoms similar to an allergic reaction rather than the gradual onset typical of pneumonia. Treating a critically ill patient with a high-dose steroid and an antihistamine resulted in normal oxygen levels the next day and a full recovery.

457	0.2635	0.1399	Dr. Shankara Chetty of South Africa has treated over 8000 patients with COVID-19 and observed a pattern in their disease progression. All patients seemed to improve around the 5th to 6th day, but some would suddenly worsen on day 8, developing symptoms similar to pneumonia. However, Dr. Chetty found that this wasn't pneumonia, but an allergic reaction in the lungs, likely to viral particles left over after the body has fought off the virus. This reaction restricts lung expansion, not airflow, and comes on rapidly, unlike pneumonia. 

Dr. Chetty suggests that this illness is biphasic, with the second phase being where mortality and morbidity occur. He successfully treated a critically ill patient with pre-existing conditions by administering a high dose steroid and an antihistamine. The patient's oxygen levels returned to normal and she fully recovered. None of Dr. Chetty's patients have experienced long-term complications of COVID-19. His findings suggest that the illness may be related to mast cell degranulation, or the release of histamines, and he recommends adding antihistamines to COVID-19 treatment protocols.

These marketing campaigns, akin to propaganda, are particularly prevalent for addictive or regularly used products. Many companies also offer solutions to the side effects caused by their products, aiming to secure lifelong consumers. They avoid providing true solutions that would cause them to lose customers. Any business on the stock market prioritizes shareholder satisfaction, often choosing cheaper, less safe or ethical product options if it means higher profits. For instance, the Soda Pop Board of America's 1950s campaign promoted soda as a healthy lifestyle choice, a tactic still employed by modern cola companies.

565	0.2602	0.1258	"Dr. Irene Ken, whose daughter is an Assistant Professor in Infectious Disease at Johns Hopkins University, has shared important information about COVID-19. The virus, a protein molecule (DNA) covered by a lipid (fat) layer, is not a living organism. It decays on its own, with the disintegration time varying based on temperature, humidity, and the material it is on. The virus is fragile, protected only by its fat layer, which can be cut by soap or detergent, causing the virus to disperse and break down. Heat, alcohol mixtures over 65%, and a mix of 1 part bleach and 5 parts water can also dissolve the fat and break down the virus. Oxygenated water can further help, but it must be pure and can hurt the skin. Antibiotics or bactericides do not work against the virus as it is not a living organism. The virus remains stable in cold, moist, and dark environments but degrades faster in dry, warm, and bright ones. UV light can break down the virus protein, useful for disinfecting objects like masks. The virus cannot penetrate healthy skin. Vinegar and spirits or vodka (less than 65% alcohol) are not effective, but Listerine (65% alcohol) is. The virus can be more concentrated in confined spaces, and less so in open or naturally ventilated ones. Handwashing before and after touching various objects and using the bathroom is crucial, as is moisturizing dry hands and keeping nails short to prevent the virus from hiding in micro-cracks or under nails."

He believes that this system benefits the powerful while the general public loses. He has been fined for attending gatherings to disseminate information and plans to challenge this in court. He alleges that his social media is being censored because he is spreading what he believes to be the truth about the Covid situation. 

He also believes that 5G and artificial intelligence are key to this new order, and that they pose a threat to farmers and the general public. He is concerned about the potential dystopian implications of these technologies. 

He cites a CDC document titled "CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel" dated July 13, 2020. According to him, the document admits that there are no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV currently available, implying that the virus has not been isolated and therefore its existence cannot be verified. He argues that this means the CDC does not have a measurable amount of the virus. 

He also raises concerns about health passports and vaccinations, seeing them as tools of coercion. He fears the potential consequences of the first vaccine.	CDC admits Covid-19 doesn’t exist.

667	0.2595	0.2485	David Mason-Jones refutes the claim that cows contribute significantly to global warming. He argues that cows, as part of the carbon cycle, do not add new carbon to the atmosphere. They consume plants, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. When cows exhale carbon dioxide or belch methane, they are simply returning carbon to the atmosphere that was already there. Furthermore, methane, while a potential global warming gas, reverts back to carbon dioxide and water vapour in the oxygen-rich atmosphere. He concludes that the carbon emissions of cows are part of a closed and self-completing carbon cycle in the atmosphere, involving all plants and animals.

1) Regularly consume hot liquids such as coffee, soups, teas, and warm water.
2) Gargle with an antiseptic in warm water daily, if possible.
3) The virus can attach to hair and clothes, so bathe or shower upon returning home. If clothes cannot be washed daily, hang them in sunlight to help neutralize the virus.
4) Clean metallic surfaces carefully as the virus can remain viable on these for up to nine days.
5) Do not smoke.
6) Wash your hands every 20 minutes for 20 seconds with a foaming soap.
7) Consume fruits and vegetables to elevate your zinc levels.
8) The virus is transmitted from person to person, not from animals to people.
9) Avoid getting the common flu and consuming cold food and drinks.
10) If you feel any discomfort in your throat, address it immediately using the above methods.

Additionally, to help detect infection, breathe in deeply and hold your breath for 10 seconds each morning. If this can be done without coughing or difficulty, it indicates no fibrosis in the lungs and thus, the absence of infection.	These ten tips help prevent coronavirus

The investigation revealed that Covid-19 is not a virus, but a bacterium exposed to radiation that causes blood to clot and leads to human death. This blood clotting causes difficulty in breathing as the brain, heart, and lungs cannot receive oxygen, leading to rapid death. Singaporean doctors performed autopsies on Covid-19 victims, despite WHO's procedures, and found dilated blood vessels filled with blood clots. This discovery led the Singapore Ministry of Health to change the Covid-19 treatment plan, introducing aspirin for positive patients, which resulted in patient recovery. More than 14,000 patients were evacuated and sent home within a day. The treatment method for this disease involves antibiotic tablets, anti-inflammatories, and anticoagulants (aspirin). Singaporean scientists claim that ventilators and ICUs are not necessary for this disease. The information should be shared to alleviate fear of Covid-19 and to inform that it is not a virus, but a bacterium exposed to radiation. People with very low immunity should be careful. Victims should take Asprin-100mg and Apronik or Paracetamol 650mg. (Source: Ministry of Health, Singapore)'	Singapore is the first country to perform an autopsy on a Covid-19 victim

1041	0.2604	0.1045	Expecting parents are urged to research the potential risks associated with routine newborn Vitamin K injections. Two products, Amphastar and Hospira, are commonly used. Amphastar contains Polysorbate 80 and Propylene Glycol, both considered neurotoxins and potential carcinogens. Polysorbate 80 is also linked to an increased risk of infertility from premature ovarian failure. The Vitamin K shot also contains 9 mg of Benzyl Alcohol, which can damage the liver and contribute to jaundice in infants. The Hospira product contains aluminum, which in high doses can cause kidney failure and brain damage. Despite these concerns, all newborns receive Vitamin K injections within hours of birth unless otherwise specified by the parents. Therefore, parents should be proactive in their research and decision-making regarding these injections.	If this virus is new and there is no cure how the hell it is in the back of a Lysol can

1. Holding urine for too long, which can cause bladder damage and increase the risk of kidney infections, urinary tract infections, nephritis, and uremia.
2. Consuming more than 5.8 grams of salt daily.
3. Eating excessive amounts of meat which leads to high protein levels in your diet. The digestion of protein produces ammonia, a toxin harmful to your kidneys.
4. Overconsumption of caffeine, found in many sodas and soft drinks, which increases your blood pressure and affects kidney health.
5. Insufficient water intake. The kidneys need to be properly hydrated to function well. Drinking more than 10 glasses of water daily is recommended. The lighter the color of your urine, the better.
6. Delaying medical treatment. Regular health checks and proper treatment of health issues are essential.

Avoid certain medications like D-cold, Vicks Action-500, Actified, Coldarin, Cosome, Nice, Nimulid, and Cetrizet-D as they contain Phenyl Propanol-Amide PPA, which can cause strokes.

Additional health tips include:

- Avoid scratching recharge cards with your nails as they may contain a Silver Nitro Oxide coating that can cause skin cancer.
- Answer phone calls with the left ear.
- Avoid taking medicine with cold water.
- Avoid heavy meals after 5pm.
- Drink more water in the morning and less at night.
- The optimal sleeping time is from 10pm to 4 am.
- Avoid lying down immediately after taking medicine or eating.
- Avoid answering the phone when the battery is low as the radiation is stronger.	US doctors found a new type of cancer

1330	0.2626	0.2010	The US court ordered the release of over 90,000 pages of Pfizer data this week. The preliminary analysis indicates that Pfizer was aware of potential harm to fetuses in pregnant women from their vaccine. The data also suggests that the vaccine's efficacy rate is not 95%, but rather 12%. The relative risk reduction from the vaccine was found to be minimal, reducing the risk of Covid death from 0.3% to 0.26%, potentially putting individuals at a greater risk of severe adverse reactions than from Covid-19 itself. The absolute risk reduction of the Covid-19 vaccine is 0.84%, less than 1%, according to Pfizer's data. This indicates that the benefit of the Pfizer vaccine is less than 1% over someone who is not vaccinated. The protection from the vaccine is also temporary, leading to the push for booster shots every three months. The documents can be found on the website of the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency. The report concludes that both BNT 162b1 and BNT162b2 vaccines are well-tolerated and have an acceptable safety profile in participants aged 18 to 85 years. Despite the decrease in efficacy over time, the vaccines still induced strong SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific and S protein-specific T-cell responses in both younger and older participants.

By the mid-1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. From 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and another 300,000 were sold as slaves, leading to a significant decrease in Ireland's population. The British separated families, leaving a large population of homeless women and children, who were then auctioned off. During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children were sold as slaves in the West Indies, Virginia, and New England. Irish slaves were often treated worse than their African counterparts due to their cheaper cost and religious differences. The English bred Irish women with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion, a practice that was later banned due to economic reasons. England continued to ship Irish slaves for more than a century, with records showing thousands of Irish slaves sold to America and Australia after the 1798 Irish Rebellion.

Given the average American work week of 40 hours and a minimum weekly gas purchase of 40 gallons, the net income reduces to $4 per hour after gas expenses. Consequently, those on minimum wage essentially work to pay for gas. Despite the promise of a $15 per hour wage by President Biden, the rising cost of gas negates this increase. As a result, workers are earning less now than they did two years ago. In a few weeks, those on minimum wage may effectively pay to work, thereby reducing household net income.'

1492	0.2641	0.1668	The Canadian government is rebranding Canada Pension checks as "Federal Benefit Payments." This terminology is misleading as these are not benefits but returns on personal investments made by individuals and their employers over their working lives. With an average contribution of 15% of pre-tax income, a person earning $30K per year would have invested approximately $180,000 in their pension. If this amount was invested at a modest 1% interest rate compounded monthly, it would amount to more than $1.3 million after 40 years. On retirement, a 3% annual withdrawal would yield $39,318 per year, or $3,277 per month, nearly three times the current average Old Age Pension benefit of $1,230 per month. This fund would last for over 33 years, supporting individuals until they are 98 if they retire at 65. The government's use of these funds for other purposes without consent or interest payment is akin to a Ponzi scheme. It is not the fault of the contributors if these funds are now insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to demand that the government acknowledges this as our Earned Retirement Income and finds a way to sustain the Canada Pension for the 92% of the population who rely on it.

He found that normal cells require oxygen, but cancer cells can live without it. Depriving a cell of 35% of its oxygen for 48 hours may make it cancerous. Warburg also found that cancer cells are anaerobic and cannot survive in high levels of oxygen, as found in an alkaline state. Cancer cells thrive in a lower pH, as low as 6.0, due to lactic acid production and elevated CO2. He believed there was a direct relationship between pH and oxygen. Higher pH means higher concentration of oxygen molecules, while lower pH means lower concentrations of oxygen. The author argues against mandatory mask wearing, claiming it decreases oxygen intake and increases CO2 intake to potentially toxic levels, and could be a health risk. They advise not to trust the WHO, but independent scientists and doctors without a globalist agenda, and hold governments and leaders accountable for potential harm caused by these policies.

We were devastated and he fell into a depression, haunted by nightmares of the amputation. A few days later, I bumped into my old dentist who introduced us to a morning routine that could help control his type 2 diabetes. Despite initial skepticism, we tried it and his blood sugar levels started to drop, along with his weight. His energy levels also increased significantly. In a few weeks, his sugar levels normalized and he was healthier than before, with his leg still intact. Today, he's full of energy and can enjoy his favorite meals without worry, reminding me of the man I knew 30 years ago. I'm grateful for the chance encounter with my dentist, it was a lifesaver.

This phenomenon, known as microchimerism, involves the integration of male cells into a woman's body after sex. These genetically distinct male cells can be found in the woman's brain and may also be present in a fetus if the woman becomes pregnant. The study suggests that the greater the number of sexual partners a woman has, the more male DNA she carries. This has led to calls for more education about the potential long-term effects of sexual activity and the promotion of abstinence outside of marriage.'

However, Unilever also partnered with Gavi - The Vaccine Alliance, a group funded by the Gates Foundation, on a large-scale hygiene and vaccination program. This initiative, which involved nearly 2.9 million bars of soap and over $3 million, allegedly resulted in the poisoning of millions of children under five overseas due to the high levels of aluminum in the vaccines. It's claimed that the aluminum levels in these vaccines are far more dangerous when injected, particularly into infants, than when applied topically, such as in deodorant. For example, one Pediarix vaccine contains 850 mcg of aluminum, while the FDA's safe injection limit for a two-month-old baby is 25 mcg.	Pediarix vaccine contains unsafe amount of aluminum

Batteries, both rechargeable and single-use, contain toxic, heavy metals. Most batteries in the U.S. are not recycled and end up in landfills, where they continue to leak small amounts of electricity and toxic substances. 

The production of EV batteries involves mining for toxic components and processing large amounts of earth's crust. A significant part of the cobalt used in batteries comes from Congo, where mines lack pollution controls and employ children who die from handling the toxic material. 

Solar panels and windmills also have environmentally destructive production costs. Solar arrays require the use of various highly toxic chemicals and cannot be recycled. Windmills are heavy, contain hard to extract rare earths, and their blades cannot be recycled. 

Despite the green claims, these technologies have hidden and embedded costs that are destructive to the Earth's environment.	Green energy is more destructive to the Earth's environment than implied

Set an alarm every two hours to get up, walk for 15-30 minutes, and move your arms frequently to help open your lungs. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth to strengthen your lungs and help clear any pneumonia or fluid. 

When sitting, maintain an upright position and avoid leaning back to prevent lung compression. Take short walks during TV commercial breaks. 

Maintain a healthy diet including eggs, bananas, avocados, and asparagus for potassium. Stay hydrated with Pedialyte, Gatorade Zero, Powerade Zero, and electrolyte water, preferably at room temperature or warm. Avoid dairy products and pork. 

Recommended drinks include water with lemon and a little honey, peppermint tea, and apple cider. 

Consider taking vitamins D3, C, B, Zinc, and a one-day Probiotic. Tylenol may be used for fever, Mucinex or Mucinex DM for drainage and cough relief, and Pepcid for leg cramps. A daily baby aspirin may help prevent blood clots due to low activity. 

A smoothie of blueberries, strawberries, bananas, honey, tea, and peanut butter is also recommended.

CO2 is unstable and heavy, extinguishes fires, and is found in soft drinks. It also nourishes oceanic plankton, which contributes 50 to 85 percent of the Earth's atmospheric oxygen. NASA reports that increased CO2 levels make the Earth greener, leading to more trees, leaves, and oxygen. Early mammals and plants thrived at 2000 parts per million of CO2, which is the level used in greenhouses today. Early humans also tolerated higher CO2 levels, as do current space ships and submarines, which can withstand up to 3000 and 5000 parts per million, respectively. However, it's important to note that man-made CO2 only accounts for 0.1 to 0.2% of atmospheric greenhouse gases, making it a minor contributor to global temperature and climate.

Prenatal ultrasound, which has become a routine procedure, is associated with risks such as stress hormone elevation, brain damage, speech delay, hearing loss, fetal malformation, personality anomalies, and genetic damage. Research indicates that it may also lead to increased skin issues like eczema, allergies, jaundice, and cancers.

However, in Australia, undocumented immigrants are reportedly provided with various benefits including employment, free education, healthcare, and social security. The Australian Federal Government also provides financial assistance to these immigrants with a higher weekly allowance than that given to Australian aged pensioners. This has led to concerns among some citizens who believe that the welfare of Australian pensioners, defense personnel, and farmers should be prioritized over refugees. They argue that these groups have significantly contributed to the country's growth and deserve more support from the government. Furthermore, they feel that the voices of these groups are often ignored by the government and media in favor of addressing the complaints of immigrants about cultural insensitivity.

1718	0.2649	0.0412	Singaporean public health expert Dr. Leong Hoe Nam explains that fully vaccinated people, especially those aged 60 and above, can still contract Covid-19 due to their low antibody levels. This is often due to the medications they take for chronic conditions, which can weaken the vaccine's efficacy. Hence, it is crucial for these individuals to receive booster shots.

The new COVID-19 Delta variant is different, deadly, and often undetectable. Symptoms include joint pain, headache, neck pain, upper back pain, pneumonia, general weakness, and loss of appetite, but often not fever or cough. This variant is more virulent with a higher death rate, and can quickly become severe, sometimes without symptoms.

The Delta variant does not primarily reside in the nasopharyngeal region but directly affects the lungs, leading to shorter periods of illness. Many patients have been diagnosed with mild chest pneumonia without fever or pain. Nasal swab tests often return negative results for this variant, leading to increased false negatives.

The virus spreads directly to the lungs, causing acute respiratory stress and viral pneumonia, making it more virulent and deadly. It is advised to be cautious, avoid crowded places, maintain social distance, use double masks, face shields, and wash hands frequently. This wave is more deadly than the previous ones, so it's essential to take all necessary precautions and inform friends and family about these risks.

Key points include maintaining hygiene by washing hands and maintaining physical distance. There's no need to disinfect home surfaces if no COVID-19 patient is present. COVID-19 is not a foodborne illness and cannot be destroyed by consuming hot water or certain foods. It's a respiratory droplet infection, not airborne for long periods. Normal soap is sufficient for protection, and there's no need to worry about packaged goods. Wearing masks for long periods can interfere with breathing, and gloves can accumulate the virus, so regular hand washing is more effective. Immunity is not boosted by staying in a sterile environment or eating certain foods, but by exposure to pathogens. Therefore, it's important to go outside regularly. Avoid paranoia and live life to the fullest, sensibly and informed.	Advice given by Dr. Bonnie Henry of British Columbia

He notes that while many women are upset with President Trump's language, they also bought 80 million copies of '50 Shades of Gray'. He criticizes the lack of feminist defense for Sarah Sanders, suggesting that women's rights are only a concern for liberals. Allen also points out the irony of Chelsea Clinton's high-paying job at NBC after college while her mother speaks out about white privilege. He argues that the cost of Trump's proposed border wall is less than the Obamacare website. Allen warns that the U.S. is one election away from open borders, socialism, gun confiscation, and full-term abortion. He mentions the heavy military response to Roger Stone's arrest compared to the defense of Benghazi. He also contrasts the financial contributions Russia made to the Trump campaign and the Clinton Foundation. Allen criticizes the invitation of illegal aliens to the State of the Union by Nancy Pelosi, while Trump invited victims of illegal aliens. He expresses concern about the potential for socialism to lead to communism. He questions how migrants can walk across Mexico without support and arrive at the U.S. border overweight and with cellphones. Allen criticizes Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's plans to ban cars and planes, implement universal income, and her belief in socialism. He recalls Bill Clinton's payment to Paula Jones to silence her, and expresses gratitude that Hillary Clinton did not become president. He criticizes the media for their predictions about the 2016 election and their reporting on Trump's approval ratings. He quotes Margaret Thatcher's critique of socialism and points out the hypocrisy of Maxine Waters' opposition to voter ID laws while requiring photo ID for her town hall meetings.

Drinking two glasses of water after waking up activates internal organs, one glass 30 minutes before a meal aids digestion, one glass before taking a bath lowers blood pressure, and one glass before bed can prevent strokes or heart attacks. Nightly hydration can also prevent leg cramps. Most heart attacks occur during the day, between 6 am and noon. Dr. Virend Somers, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, suggests that taking an aspirin at night, due to its 24-hour lifespan, can help prevent heart attacks, especially as Bayer is developing fast-dissolving aspirin. If a heart attack occurs, immediately dissolve two aspirin in your mouth and swallow with water. Symptoms can include chest and arm pain, intense jaw or neck pain, nausea, and sweating. If these symptoms wake you, call a neighbor or nearby family member, say "heart attack", sit near your front door, and do not lie down. Sharing this information could potentially save lives.

1956	0.2658	0.2625	Dr. Shankara Chetty from South Africa has proposed a new understanding of COVID-19, suggesting it behaves more like an allergic reaction than pneumonia. He has treated over 8000 patients and noticed a consistent disease pattern. Patients typically improve around the 5th to 6th day, but a group worsens on the 8th day, developing symptoms similar to pneumonia. However, he found that the oxygen flow wasn't restricted like in pneumonia, but rather the lungs were inflamed and couldn't expand, similar to an allergic reaction. 

He noticed that the illness could potentially have two phases, with the second phase being where mortality and morbidity occur. He treated a critically ill patient with a high dose steroid and an antihistamine, after which her oxygen levels normalized and she recovered. None of his patients have experienced COVID-19 complications or long-term effects. He is currently working with long-term COVID-19 patients and believes their symptoms are related to mast cell degranulation - a release of histamine. 

Dr. Chetty suggests adding antihistamines to COVID-19 treatment protocols. He may be the only doctor tracking this illness so closely and it's important to note that the I-MASK protocols have been altered to include Singulair, a medication used to prevent asthma attacks.	COVID-19-induced pneumonia is "is actually mast cell degranulation of the lungs," a type of allergic reaction.

Cash is a liquid asset that can be immediately used for economic actions. Without physical currency, control over your assets becomes a digital illusion managed by banks and governments. These entities can potentially manipulate, postpone, or lock your funds in various circumstances, even if they're operating illegally. Every physical penny represents your control and power of economic circulation. If a bank has your cash, it has control. Banks charge various fees while they operate with your money. Using cash is a way to maintain control over your finances. It's against the law for anyone to refuse cash payment in exchange for goods and services.

2317	0.2639	0.1934	Simplot Australia, the only Australian manufacturer of frozen Australian grown vegetables, is on the brink of closure. Other Australian brands have moved their plants to New Zealand to access the Chinese market, making it difficult for Simplot to compete. If Simplot closes, Australia will no longer have locally grown frozen vegetables available, leading to reliance on imported food. This situation is concerning due to the potential lack of strict agricultural guidelines in other countries, loss of Australian jobs, and inability to self-sustain in case of global instability. It is crucial to support Australian brands like Birdseye and Edgell, both of which sell products via Simplot. The closure of Simplot would also mean that China gains control over Australia's fresh and frozen vegetable industry, with Chinese-grown vegetables potentially being mislabeled as products of New Zealand. Therefore, it's important to consider the future of Australian food and support local brands.	Simplot plans to close down Australian frozen vegetable manufacturing

The virus does not cause a cold nose or cough with cold, but it does create a dry and rough cough. The virus typically first installed in the throat causing inflammation and a feeling of dryness. This symptom can last between 3 and 4 days. The virus typically then travels through the moisture present in the airways, goes down to the trachea and installs in the lungs, causing pneumonia that lasts about 5 or 6 days. Pneumonia manifests with a high fever and difficulty breathing. The virus hates heat and dies if it is exposed to temperatures greater than 80°F (27°C). Therefore hot drinks such as infusions, broths or simply hot water should be consumed abundantly during the day. These hot liquids kill the virus and are easy to ingest. Avoid drinking ice water or drinks with ice cubes. Ensure that your mouth and throat are always wet, never DRY. You should drink a sip of water at least every 15 minutes. For those who can, sunbathe. The Sun's UV rays kill the virus and the vitamin D is good for you. The Coronavirus has a large size (diameter of 400-500 nanometers) so face masks can stop it, no special face masks are needed in daily life. If an infected person sneezes nearby, stay 10 feet (3.3 meters) away to allow the virus fall to the ground and prevent it from falling on you. The virus can live nested in clothes and tissues between 6 and 12 hours. Common detergents can kill it. Things that cannot be washed should be exposed to the Sun and the virus will die. The transmission of the virus usually occurs by direct infection, touching fabrics, tissues or materials on which the virus is present. Washing your hands is essential. The virus survives on our hands for only about 10 minutes. In	Advice sent to NHS staff on how to prevent novel coronavirus

It's particularly dangerous to drive with a mask on due to the risk of losing consciousness from stale air. Therefore, it's advisable to use a mask when in close proximity to others and to lift it every 10 minutes for health maintenance.

He emphasizes the importance of booster shots for these individuals. 

He also warns of the new COVID-19 Delta variant, which presents different symptoms such as joint pain, headache, neck pain, upper back pain, pneumonia, general weakness, and loss of appetite, often without the common symptoms of cough and fever. The Delta variant is more virulent and has a higher death rate. It does not reside in the nasopharyngeal region but directly affects the lungs, leading to acute respiratory stress and viral pneumonia. This strain can often yield negative results on nasal swab tests, leading to false negatives. 

Dr. Leong advises caution, recommending avoidance of crowded places, maintaining a distance of 1.5m even in open spaces, using double masks and face shields, and frequent hand washing. He stresses that this wave is more deadly than the first, and urges everyone to take all necessary precautions and share this information widely.

This bump includes a wider population of both at-risk and non-at-risk individuals. Despite the curve being skewed upwards due to more sick individuals being tested than healthy ones, the downward trend of the second bump suggests herd immunity has been reached and the virus is dying out.

If blood doesn't appear, apply pressure to the fingers. Once all fingers are bleeding, the patient should regain consciousness. The next step is to massage the patient's ears until they become red.
