FROM Arvind Khamitkar , I.A.S, Director of Medical 
& Research Div, 
Chennai 

Dear Friends,

A few weeks ago, in a movie theatre, a person felt 
something poking from her seat. 
When she got up to see what it was, she found a 
needle sticking out of the seat with a note attached saying 

"You have just been infected by 
HIV". 

The Disease Control Center (in Paris ) reports many similar 
events in many other cities recently. All tested needles were HI V Positive. 

The Center also reports that needles have been found 
in cash dispensers at public banking machines. We ask everyone to use extreme caution when faced with 
this kind of situation. All public chairs/seats should be inspected with vigilance and caution before use. A careful visual inspection should be enough..... In addition, they ask that each of you pass this message along to all members of your family and your friends of the potential danger. 

Recently, one doctor has narrated a somewhat similar 
instance that hppened to one of his patients at the Priya Cinema in Delhi . A young girl, engaged and about to be married in a couple of months, was pricked while the movie 
was going on. The tag with the needle had the message 

"Welcome to the World of HIV family".

months

Individuals can be targeted for this medical kidnapping by armed troops via “telephone assessments,” and the medical kidnapping of American citizens is being labeled “involuntary commitment” to “temporary quarantine and isolation facilities.”

In other words, FEMA-style concentration camps are here, and covid is the excuse for mass arrests and executions of Americans.

These are, of course, death camps being constructed and operated under the cover of the covid plandemic, which we have exhaustively shown is rooted in junk science fraud and media psychological operations.

More info:

The name "Easter" originated with the names of an ancient Goddess and God. The Venerable Bede, (672-735 CE), a Christian scholar, first asserted in his book De Ratione Temporum that Easter was named after Eostre (a.k.a. Eastre). She was the Great Mother Goddess of the Saxon people in Northern Europe. Similarly, the "Teutonic dawn goddess of fertility [was] known variously as Ostare, Ostara, Ostern, Eostra, Eostre, Eostur, Eastra, Eastur, Austron and Ausos." 1 Her name was derived from the ancient word for spring: "eastre." Similar Goddesses were known by other names in ancient cultures around the Mediterranean, and were celebrated in the springtime. Some were:

Aphrodite, named Cytherea (Lady of Cythera) and Cypris (Lady of Cyprus) after the two places which claimed her birth; 8

Another thing is that the companies that sell these products quite often try to pull a swifty on people, they use loopholes, celebrities and sports stars, bribe politicians, create false studies and articles to show the benefits of their product.

The marketing campaigns which you could call propaganda generally use all of the above tactics plus more especially if its a product that will be either addictive or a product that you will need to get use on a regular basis.

Many companies also own both sides of the pie as they know the junk product that they sell will cause side effects so they also try to offer the solution.

They also know the golden ticket is a life long consumer.

Lets say a product you use has long term side effect this is perfect for them as then they can offer you the band aid another product that you will need to use forever to stay well.

The problem is they never give the true solution as these solutions which there are thousands would make them lose you as a customer and that can never happen they will do everything they can to claw you in so they have you for life.

Is there any products lately that have had massive marketing pushes?

Ask yourself why? Remember any business that is on the share market has only one customer that they must keep happy and that is the share holders and all they care about is profit.

Mid-morning and late afternoon times are ideal. There are also alternatives to sunscreen. Some examples are carrot seed oil, zinc cream, and red raspberry seed oil. The sun is an amazing God given element that is actually very healing and provides nutrients we need and yet again we have been lied to about believing it is dangerous by the people who are profiting off our sickness!

“The virus is not a living organism, but a protein molecule (DNA) covered by a protective layer of lipid (fat), which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal, or buccal mucosa, changes their genetic code (mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells. 
*Since the virus is not a living organism, but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decays on its own. The disintegration time depends on the temperature, humidity, and type of material where it lies. 
*The virus is very fragile; the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat. That is why any soap or detergent is the best remedy, because the foam CUTS the FAT (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more, to make a lot of foam). 
*By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own. 
*HEAT melts fat; that is why it is so good to use water above 77 degrees Fahrenheit for washing hands, clothes, and everything. In addition, hot water makes more foam and that makes it even more useful.

Also, there is something called a "thyroid guard" for use during mammograms. By coincidence, I had my yearly mammogram yesterday. I felt a little silly, but I asked about the guard and sure enough, the technician had one in a drawer. I asked why it wasn't routinely used. Answer: "I don't know. You have to ask for it."

This virus is characterized by obstructing respiratory pathways with thick mucus that solidifies and blocks the airways and lungs. So they have discovered that in order to apply a medicine you have to open and unblock these airways so that the treatment can be used to take effect however all of this takes a number of days. Their recommendations for what you can do to safeguard yourself are ...

1) Drink lots of hot liquids - coffees, soups, teas, warm water. In addition take a sip of warm water every 20 minutes bc this keeps your mouth moist and washes any of the virus that’s entered your mouth into your stomach where your gastric juices will neutralize it before it can get to the lungs.
2) Gargle with an antiseptic and warm water like vinegar or salt or lemon every day if possible
3) The virus attaches itself to hair and clothes. And detergent or soap kills it but you must take bath or shower when you get in from the street. Avoid sitting down in your home and go straight to the shower. If you cannot wash your clothes daily, hang them in sunlight which also helps to neutralize the virus
4) Wash metallic surfaces very carefully bc the virus can stay viable on these for up to 9 days. Take note and be vigilant about touching hand rails, door knobs, etc

If you calculate the future value of your monthly investment in a pension ($375/month, including both you and your employers contributions) at a meagre 1% interest rate compounded monthly, after 40 years of working you'd have more than $1.3+ million dollars saved! This is your personal investment. Upon retirement, if you took out only 3% per year, you'd receive $39,318 per year, or $3,277 per month. That's almost three times more than today's average Old Age Pension benefit of $1,230 per month. And your retirement fund would last more than 33 years (until you're 98 if you retire at age 65)!

Cancer is one of the most terrible and the deadliest diseases of modern age. Although massive research has been done and millions of dollars have been spent in a vigorous attempt to find the cure, no progression has been made yet.

On the other hand, it has been statistically shown that cancer is of the most profitable diseases for the Big Pharma. These days, we are witnesses of many stories told by people who treated and cured cancer in an all-natural way, without undergoing radiation and chemotherapy.

This makes us wonder how much does Big Pharma hide from us and what we are not being told.  In brief, it seems that we are indeed kept in the dark.

For that reason, researchers from the University of Kentucky have conducted a study on the effects of grape seeds on cancer and the results are quite promising. In fact, it has been found that grape seeds destroy up to 80 percent of cancer cells.  This study was published by the American Association for Cancer Research and it is available for everyone.

Besides this study, there are many other researches on the topic which have come up with different natural ingredients which are helpful in treating cancer.

“All normal cells have an absolute requirement for oxygen, but cancer cells can live without oxygen – a rule without exception. “Deprive a cell 35% of its oxygen for 48 hours and it may become cancerous.” 
Dr. Warburg has made it clear that the root cause of cancer is oxygen deficiency, which creates an acidic state in the human body. Dr Warburg also discovered that cancer cells are anaerobic (do not breathe oxygen) and cannot survive in the presence of high levels of oxygen, as found in an alkaline state.

He showed that the root cause of cancer is too much acidity in the body, meaning that the pH, potential hydrogen, in the body is below the normal level of 7.365, which constitutes an “acidic” state. Warburg investigated the metabolism of tumours and the respiration of cells and discovered that cancer cells maintain and thrive in a lower pH, as low as 6.0, due to lactic acid production and elevated CO2. He firmly believed that there was a direct relationship between pH and oxygen. Higher pH, which is Alkaline, means higher concentration of oxygen molecules, while lower pH, which

A research by university of Seattle USA has proven that. There is now a greater understanding of why God asks us not to have sex before we get married.

So when a woman ovulates, the eggs that she produces contain more of other DNAs. So we need to educate the girlchild to remain a virgin till marriage. Anytime you have sex with another man you become one with that man spiritually too and carry the man\'s DNA. At some point when you have too many of the male DNA in you; you change, because your cells are changing. That also proves why when married couples live together for a long time they end up looking alike. The woman\'s DNA changes when she has sex with men. This is very serious. The world should know this and stop silly sex promotions. It is bad than good. Unfortunately women are the victims. This was found out in many other research articles mostly released this year.

Sleep on your stomach at all times with C*vid. If you can’t sleep on your stomach because of heath issues sleep on your side. Do not lay on your back no matter what because it smashes your lungs and that will allow fluid to set in.
Set your clock every two hours while sleeping on your stomach, then get out of bed and walk for 15-30 min, no matter how tired or weak that you are. Also move your arms around frequently, it helps to open your lungs. Breathe in thru your nose, and out thru your mouth. This will help build up your lungs, plus help get rid of the Pneumonia or other fluid you may have.
When sitting in a recliner, sit up straight - do not lay back in the recliner, again this will smash your lungs. While watching TV - get up and walk during every commercial.
Eat at least 1 - 2 eggs a day, plus bananas, avocado and asparagus.These are good for Potassium. Drink Pedialyte, Gatorade Zero, Powerade Zero & Water with Electrolytes to prevent you from becoming dehydrated. Do not drink anything cold - have it at room temperature or warm it up.

First responders tackling bushfires in Australia are being advised to kill baby kangaroos and koalas who have been orphaned as a result of the crisis. 

AUSTRALIA-A document advising first responders to kill baby koalas and kangaroos that survive the bushfires is causing distress among those working to save them. 

The Victorian Response Plan for Wildlife Impacted by Fire directs that the rehabilitation of orphaned “milk dependent joeys” from these “common species” found in the fire zone is not supported.

Contrary to established practice, the plan urges against handing the animals to wildlife volunteers, stating “these animals require significant long term care and cannot be successfully returned to the wild.”

The government plan goes on to describe methods of euthanasia which include lethal injection, blunt forced trauma and shooting.

This is despite the same document also providing instructions on how to raise the milk dependent joeys.

We cannot imagine any of this, our minds are not built for these numbers. We discussed for many years that “these times” will come but no one expected it to happen right now.

In the West, Easter is celebrated on the Sunday following the full moon next after the vernal equinox (between March 22 and April 25).

This Holy Day is actually far older than Christianity.  The name “Easter” is derived from the Old German name “Ostara,” and, in Anglo-Saxon, Eastre, or Eostre, the goddess of spring, fertility, and the rising sun. This name is a variation on the name of Ishtar, the Babylonian and Assyrian goddess of love and fertility.

Throughout Europe were celebrated rituals and sacrifices in recognition of the movement in nature from death (winter) to life (spring).  These traditions were gradually absorbed by the evangelizing Christian movements.  But the movement of the Sun, in its triumphant march toward the heavens, has been celebrated by people the world over. The spiritual value of Easter is reflected in the traditions and mythologies of many cultures and religions, all of which symbolize the esoteric or root meaning: the triumph of the Christ over the ego of the penitent seeker.

#Gnostics understand that the equinox or Holy Easter is related to the beginning of the Initiation by means of the cross or Sexual Magic, the true beginning of the development of Christ within our dense matter or physical body.

"Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified" A May 2010 scenario planning report produced by The Rockefeller Foundation and the Global Business Network envisions the likely creation of a technological police state in response to a deadly worldwide pandemic.”  The President of Ghana reads from a document posted in 2010 on the Rockefeller Institute's Website. Rockefeller Foundation paper published in 2010 predicted how a pandemic can be used as an excuse to establish global authoritarian power. The Rockefeller Foundation published a report in May 2010 in cooperation with the Global Business Network of futurologist Peter Schwartz. It was called Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development. The first scenario, titled, “Lock Step”, describes a world of total government control and authoritarian leadership.  It envisions a future where a pandemic would allow national leaders to flex their authority and impose airtight rules and restrictions that would remain after the pandemic faded. The first half of this scenario already has unfolded. Will it continue as predicted? The information on Lock Step begins at about the two-thirds point of the article. The Rockefeller report in its entirety can be downloaded here. Every day world mainstream news reports more people in more countries diagnosed “positive” for the coronavirus illness, now called

First responders tackling bushfires in Australia are being advised to kill baby kangaroos and koalas who have been orphaned as a result of the crisis. AUSTRALIA-A document advising first responders to kill baby koalas and kangaroos that survive the bushfires is causing distress among those working to save them. The Victorian Response Plan for Wildlife Impacted by Fire directs that the rehabilitation of orphaned “milk dependent joeys” from these “common species” found in the fire zone is not supported. Contrary to established practice, the plan urges against handing the animals to wildlife volunteers, stating “these animals require significant long term care and cannot be successfully returned to the wild.” The government plan goes on to describe methods of euthanasia which include lethal injection, blunt forced trauma and shooting. This is despite the same document also providing instructions on how to raise the milk dependent joeys. We cannot imagine any of this, our minds are not built for these numbers.

Washing hands and maintaining a two-metre physical distance is the best method for your protection. 4. If you don't have a C19 patient at home, there's no need to disinfect the surfaces at your house. 5. Packaged cargo, gas pumps, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection. If you wash your hands, live your life as usual. 6. C19 is not a food infection. It is associated with drops of infection like the 'flu. There is no demonstrated risk that C19 is transmitted by food. 7. You can lose your sense of smell with a lot of allergies and viral infections. This is only a non-specific symptom of C19. 8. Once at home, you don't need to change your clothes urgently and go shower! Purity is a virtue, paranoia is not! 9. The C19 virus doesn't hang in the air for long.

A guy came on, based in metro Melbourne, says he’s totally respecting all the lockdowns rules. 

However he has a friend who’s dad just died at 79 years old. A Greek guy, it’s been in the news. 

The dad was in hospital for 2 weeks for late stage terminal cancer. After that he was placed back into the nursing home. 

Now to be placed back in the nursing home, all aged care returning need to be tested negative for covid. 

He was allowed back into the nursing home. So he definitely did not test positive for covid otherwise he would not be allowed back in. 

He died the next day in the nursing home. His death was labeled as covid. 

The family were upset & asked why did they put that on the death certificate when that wasn’t true? The nursing home turned around & said don’t you want a payout for the death? 

The Australian govt is handing out $25,000 to all nursing homes who label covid as the main cause of deaths on death certificates. 

Another friend verifies this story. She’s got a friend who’s father in law in Melbourne just died in a nursing home.

For the first time in the history of vaccination, the so-called last generation mRNA vaccines intervene directly in the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material, which represents the genetic manipulation, something that was already forbidden and until then considered criminal. This intervention can be compared to genetically manipulated food, which is also highly controversial. Even if the media and politicians currently trivialize the problem and even stupidly call for a new type of vaccine to return to normality, this vaccination is problematic in terms of health, morality and ethics, and also in terms of genetic damage that, unlike the damage caused by previous vaccines, will be irreversible and irreparable. Dear patients, after an unprecedented mRNA vaccine, you will no longer be able to treat the vaccine symptoms in a complementary way. They will have to live with the consequences, because they can no longer be cured simply by removing toxins from the human body

Think about this and circulate to your family and friends:
The ONLY Australian manufacturer of frozen Australian grown vegetables (Simplot Australia) whose brands are Birdseye and Edgells is not far from closing because a number of the other well-known Australian brands have moved their plants to New Zealand in order to capture the Chinese vegetable market where they market via New Zealand to Australian tables (without the food being labelled specifically as Chinese) and Simplot is finding it hard to compete.
SHOULD SIMPLOT CLOSE, THIS MEANS THAT NO AUSTRALIAN GROWN FROZEN VEGETABLES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ALL AND WE WILL BE RELYING ON FOOD GROWN TOTALLY OUTSIDE AUSTRALIA.

For a number of reasons this is not a good situation.
1. As most people know, other countries do not necessarily have the strict guidelines for growing their vegetables that Australia has and by buying Australian we can be sure that lethal chemicals that may be used in other countries will not be used on Australian vegetables.
2. We would be losing Australians jobs.
3. If ever the world became unstable regarding wartime we would not be able to feed ourselves
It is imperative that we all support these Australian brands selling good Australian vegetable products (via Simplot): Birdseye and Edgell.
Next time you shop, please think about the future of Australian food.

Hodkinson, who is the CEO of a biotech company that makes COVID tests, says "There is utterly unfounded public hysteria driven by the media and politicians." We are seeing "politics playing medicine, and that's a very dangerous game." Positive test results do not mean a clinical infection, he says. All testing should stop because the false numbers they produce are "driving public hysteria." Hodkinson says the risk of death for people under the age of 65 is "one in three-hundred thousand" and it "outrageous" to shut down society for what is merely "just another bad flu."') %}

PLEASE READ.At The Princess of Wales hospital. NHS staff have been sent this: This is the advice given to hospital staff. It explains the virus and hopefully, how to prevent getting it. Please share with family, friends and work colleagues. Virus Detection: The simplest way to distinguish Coronavirus from a Common Cold is that the COVID-19 infection does not cause a cold nose or cough with cold, but it does create a dry and rough cough. The virus is typically first installed in the throat causing inflammation and a feeling of dryness. This symptom can last between 3 and 4 days. The virus typically then travels through the moisture present in the airways, goes down to the trachea and installs in the lungs, causing pneumonia that lasts about 5 or 6 days. Pneumonia manifests with a high fever and difficulty breathing. The Common Cold is not accompanied, but there may be a choking sensation. In this case, the doctor should be called immediately. Experts suggest doing this simple verification every morning: Breathe in deeply and hold your breath for 10 seconds. If this can be done without coughing, without difficulty, this shows that there is no fibrosis in the lungs, indicating the absence of infection. It is recommended to do this control every morning to help detect infection. Prevention: The virus hates heat and dies if it

Dr Leong explains why fully vaccinated people are still getting Covid19. He said those infected by Covid19 although fully vaccinated, are the older people  (aged above 60 plus). This is because these peoples' antibodies are very Low after a lapse of time as most of them are taking medications (e.g. for diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, heart cindition etc). These medications tend to neutralise the vaccine efficacy. So he said, it is important for these senior citizens to take the booster jab. The previous jabs have now become weaker with time and the medications they took.

IS  DIFFERENT,  DEADLY  &  UNDETECTABLE:

NO COUGH

THE ROOT CAUSE OF CANCER – Dr. Otto H Warburg won the Nobel Prize in 1931 for this discovery. 
“All normal cells have an absolute requirement for oxygen, but cancer cells can live without oxygen – a rule without exception. “Deprive a cell 35% of its oxygen for 48 hours and it may become cancerous.” 
Dr. Warburg has made it clear that the root cause of cancer is oxygen deficiency, which creates an acidic state in the human body. Dr Warburg also discovered that cancer cells are anaerobic (do not breathe oxygen) and cannot survive in the presence of high levels of oxygen, as found in an alkaline state.

He showed that the root cause of cancer is too much acidity in the body, meaning that the pH, potential hydrogen, in the body is below the normal level of 7.365, which constitutes an “acidic” state. Warburg investigated the metabolism of tumours and the respiration of cells and discovered that cancer cells maintain and thrive in a lower pH, as low as 6.0, due to lactic acid production and elevated CO2. He firmly believed that there was a direct relationship between pH and oxygen. Higher pH, which is Alkaline, means higher concentration of oxygen molecules, while lower pH, which

Black cohosh, blue cohosh, & angelic root should absolutely never be taken during pregnancy especially alongside one another. These three have the capacity to disrupt hormone development & will typically cause bleeding to begin in just a handful of days in very early pregnancy

Queen Anne's lace should be avoided by anyone who's attempting to conceive, she has a tendency to make the uterine wall slippery & prevents the precious egg from implanting. It's also important to know that during pregnancy if the egg can't implant the pregnancy won't continue

For the first time in the history of vaccination, the so-called last generation mRNA vaccines intervene directly in the genetic material of the patient and therefore alter the individual genetic material, which represents the genetic manipulation, something that was already forbidden and until then considered criminal. This intervention can be compared to genetically manipulated food, which is also highly controversial. Even if the media and politicians currently trivialize the problem and even stupidly call for a new type of vaccine to return to normality, this vaccination is problematic in terms of health, morality and ethics, and also in terms of genetic damage that, unlike the damage caused by previous vaccines, will be irreversible and irreparable. Dear patients, after an unprecedented mRNA vaccine, you will no longer be able to treat the vaccine symptoms in a complementary way. They will have to live with the consequences, because they can no longer be cured simply by removing toxins from the human body, just as a person with a genetic defect like Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, genetic cardiac arrest, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Rett syndrome, etc.), because the genetic defect is forever! This means clearly: if a vaccination symptom develops after an mRNA vaccination, neither I nor any other therapist can help you, because the damage caused by the vaccination will be genetically irreversible.

If it is natural, it would adversely affect only those countries having the same temperature as China. Instead, it is spreading in a country like Switzerland, in the same way it is spreading in the desert areas. Whereas if it were natural, it would have spread in cold places, but died in hot places. I have done 40 years of research on animals and viruses. It is not natural. It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I am fully acquainted with all the staff of that laboratory. I have been phoning them all, after the Coronavirus surfaced. But all their phones are dead for the last 3 months. It is now understood that all these lab technicians have died. Based on all my knowledge and research till date, I can say this with 100% confidence - That the Coronavirus is not natural.

 The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has published a leaflet on COVID-19 testing.

 The following sentence can be found in this leaflet under PCR tests:

 "However, the detection of the nucleic acid does not give any conclusion about the presence of an infectious pathogen."👍👍👍👏👏👏

 (to be found under Test systems> PCR / NAT, page 2, link below)

 This is an official confirmation that the PCR test only detects a fragment of a virus, but does not constitute evidence that an infectious pathogen is present or that the person is contagious at all.👍👍👍

 This is not new to most of the readers here, we have been discussing this over and over for a while.  What is new is that this is clearly confirmed in an official official document.👏👏

Recent scientific research has confirmed the miracle of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) regarding “The Splitting of the Moon”.

It has been proven through a picture captured by NASA which was published throughout the world. 
The photo from NASA using Apollo 10 and Apollo 11 shows a clear indication (a line) that the Moon was split in past.

The report, spread on scientific foundations in different global parts, said that the picture which illustrates splitting of moon confirms that the moon was split into two halves during its geological age. The report said the scientists were unable to give any scientific explanation for happening of ‘moon splitting’ as any such splitting was never happened to any heavenly body prior to what happened to the moon. The geologists assert that it is impossible that such a line appears save the moon was split into two halves and then it was rejoined. 

This miracle of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is mentioned in the beginning of Sura Al-Qamar (the moon) about the split of the moon [54:1] ‘The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder (the people of Makkah requested Prophet Muhammad to show them a miracle, so he showed them the splitting of the moon)

So they have discovered that in order to apply a medicine you have to open and unblock these airways so that the treatment can be used to take effect however all of this takes a number of days. Their recommendations for what you can do to safeguard yourself are ...

1) Drink lots of hot liquids - coffees, soups, teas, warm water. In addition take a sip of warm water every 20 minutes bc this keeps your mouth moist and washes any of the virus that’s entered your mouth into your stomach where your gastric juices will neutralize it before it can get to the lungs.
2) Gargle with an antiseptic and warm water like vinegar or salt or lemon every day if possible
3) The virus attaches itself to hair and clothes. And detergent or soap kills it but you must take bath or shower when you get in from the street. Avoid sitting down in your home and go straight to the shower. If you cannot wash your clothes daily, hang them in sunlight which also helps to neutralize the virus
4) Wash metallic surfaces very carefully bc the virus can stay viable on these for up to 9 days. Take note and be vigilant about touching hand rails, door knobs, etc

The reason you can't tell it's an allergic reaction is because it's happening in the lungs, so you experience only symptoms of chest tightness and fatigue! Dr. Shankara Chetty of South Africa has closely monitored and treated over 8000 patients personally. He noticed there was something very different about viral pneumonia in comparison to C-V pneumonia and was determined to figure out what the mechanism of treatment should be. He had all of his patients come in as soon as they expressed any symptoms, he followed the progression of everyone's disease pattern and noticed something very interesting which resulted in his findings. Every person progressed the same for the first 5 days, all of them, even those who eventually went on to worsen, appeared to improve around that 5th to 6th day. But from that day forward, there were two distinct camps...one group would always go on to improve after that initial period, but the other group would suddenly worsen on day 8. Not day 7 or 9, always day 8, and they would be fine day 7, while going on to develop what we've come to recognize as C-V pneumonia. But it

* Daily payment of only one rupee, that too for the Indian Army. In the cabinet meeting yesterday, the Modi government opened a bank account for the modernity of the Indian Army and for the soldiers who are injured or martyred in the war zone. In which every Indian can donate any amount on his own free will. Which starts from Rs.1 and is unlimited.*
* This money will also be used to buy weapons for the army and paramilitary forces. Taking a final decision on today's burning situation on Mann Ki Baat and suggestions of people on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Modi government has opened Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualty Fund account in New Delhi, *Canara Bank.*
* This is the master stroke of Film Star Akshay Kumar. From where no one can stop India from becoming a super power. If even 70% of India's 130 crore population puts only one rupee daily in this fund, then that one rupee will be 100 crores in a day. 3000 crores in 30 days and 36000 crores in a year. 36,000 crores is not even the annual defense budget of Pakistan. We spend 100 or 1000 rupees daily in useless work, but if we give one rupee for the army, India will definitely become a super power.
* Your money will be directly deposited in the Defense Ministry's Army Assistance and War Casualty Fund. Which will be useful for military material and army personnel.
*That's why help the army directly by joining this campaign of Modiji.*
Nothing will happen by doing hi hi kar Pakistan, blocking roads and making rhetoric. Implement the thinking of Modi and the people of the country and strengthen the army of our country. So that countries like Pakistan and China can be told their status without the help of any other country. Bank details are given below.

It causes similar problems in us humans.

AirPods, like other Bluetooth headsets and earpods, will constantly transmit signals while they are in your ears, whether you are using them or not. Airpods sir right near your skull. They transmit RFR directly next to your brain and ear, and the RFR is absorbed into your brain and ear tissues. Apple’s second generation AirPods are Bluetooth Class 1 – meaning they reach to hundreds of feet away and emit higher radiation compared to other Bluetooth devices. The left AirPod communicates with the right AirPod using a technology called “near field magnetic induction” (NFMI). The fields go right though your brain. Magnetic fields are linked to cancer and oxidative stress.') %}

AirPods and other Bluetooth earbuds emit wireless radiofrequency radiation, which has been classified as a potential carcinogen by the World Health Organization and is warned against by numerous governments and medical organizations due to its potential health risks.
